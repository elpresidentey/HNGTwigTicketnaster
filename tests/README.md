## Test Requirements Covered

The tests fulfill the following requirements from the specification:

### Authentication Requirements

- **Requirement 2.5**: Authentication state management
- **Requirement 3.1**: Route protection and redirection

### Ticket Management Requirements
- **Requirement 4.1**: Create new tickets with validation
- **Requirement 4.2**: Validate ticket fields (title, status, description)
- **Requirement 5.1**: Retrieve and display tickets for current user
- **Requirement 6.1**: Update and delete existing tickets

### Ticket Page Redesign Requirements
- **Requirement 1.2**: Display username from session
- **Requirement 4.2**: Navigate to ticket creation
- **Requirement 4.3**: Navigate to ticket list view
- **Requirement 5.5**: Update statistics after ticket operations

## Mock Objects

The tests use mock implementations of:
- `localStorage` - For client-side storage simulation
- `sessionStorage` - For temporary data storage
- `window.location` - For navigation testing

## Test Framework

The tests use a simple custom test framework that provides:
- `describe()` - Test suite grouping
- `it()` - Individual test cases
- `expect()` - Assertion methods
  - `toBe()` - Strict equality
  - `toEqual()` - Deep equality
  - `toBeTruthy()` - Truthy value check
  - `toBeFalsy()` - Falsy value check
  - `toContain()` - String/array containment
  - `toBeGreaterThan()` - Numeric comparison

## Notes

- All tests run in isolation with fresh mock storage
- Tests focus on core authentication logic without UI dependencies
- Error scenarios are thoroughly tested to ensure robust error handling
- Session expiration and cleanup functionality is validated
