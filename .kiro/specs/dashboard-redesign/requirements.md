# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the dashboard UI to match the modern, clean design language established in the landing page. The redesign will transform the current dashboard into a visually cohesive experience that maintains consistency with the landing page's gradient backgrounds, glass morphism effects, modern typography, and smooth animations.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard System**: The authenticated user interface that displays ticket statistics and quick actions
- **Design Language**: The visual style, patterns, and components established in the landing page redesign
- **Glass Morphism**: A design technique using semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effects
- **Gradient Background**: Multi-color background transitions used for visual depth
- **Stat Card**: A component displaying numerical ticket statistics (open, in progress, closed)
- **Quick Action Card**: An interactive component providing shortcuts to common tasks
- **Responsive Design**: UI that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
