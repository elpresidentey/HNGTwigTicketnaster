   - Click individual test buttons for specific categories
   - Click "Run All Tests" for complete suite

3. **Review Results:**
   - Green (✓) = Pass
   - Yellow (⚠) = Warning (fallback working)
   - Red (✗) = Fail
   - Check summary for overall statistics

4. **Document Results:**
   - Note browser version
   - Record pass/fail/warning counts
   - Document any issues found

### Manual Testing

## Known Issues and Fallbacks

### Firefox < 103
**Issue:** backdrop-filter not enabled by default  
**Solution:** Enable `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` flag or use fallback  
**Fallback:** Solid semi-transparent backgrounds

### Safari < 9
**Issue:** No backdrop-filter support  
**Solution:** Use -webkit- prefix for newer versions, fallback for older  
**Fallback:** Solid semi-transparent backgrounds

### Gradient Banding
**Issue:** Some browsers may show gradient banding  
**Solution:** Use more color stops, check color space settings  
**Impact:** Visual only, no functionality impact

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint:** < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** < 2.5s
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** < 0.1
- **Animation Frame Rate:** 60 FPS

### Actual Performance
- **Chrome:** Excellent (60 FPS)

- **Edge:** Excellent (60 FPS)

## Accessibility Compliance

✓ Keyboard navigation tested  
✓ Focus states visible  
✓ Screen reader compatible

✓ Prefers-reduced-motion supported  
✓ Touch targets meet minimum size (44px)  

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
