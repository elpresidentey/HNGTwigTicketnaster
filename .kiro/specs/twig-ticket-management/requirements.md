# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Twig-based Ticket Management Web App is a server-rendered implementation that provides comprehensive ticket management functionality using the Twig templating engine. The system enables users to authenticate, manage tickets through CRUD operations, and maintain session state using localStorage simulation. The application emphasizes lightweight server rendering with minimal JavaScript for enhanced interactivity while maintaining graceful degradation capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Twig_App**: The server-rendered ticket management web application using Twig templating engine
- **Auth_System**: The authentication simulation system using localStorage tokens
- **Ticket_Manager**: The client-side JavaScript module handling CRUD operations for tickets
- **Session_Token**: The localStorage-stored authentication token (ticketapp_session)
- **Dashboard_View**: The authenticated user's main interface displaying ticket statistics
- **Landing_Page**: The public homepage with hero section and navigation
- **Ticket_Entity**: A data structure containing title, status, description, and metadata
- **CRUD_Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for ticket management
- **Toast_System**: The user feedback mechanism for displaying action results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view an attractive landing page with hero content, so that I can understand the application's purpose and navigate to authentication.

3. THE Twig_App SHALL provide navigation links to login and signup pages
4. THE Twig_App SHALL load shared assets including hero-wave.svg from the assets directory
5. THE Twig_App SHALL maintain consistent design language with rounded corners and box shadows

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using login and signup forms, so that I can access the ticket management features securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials, THE Auth_System SHALL store Session_Token in localStorage as "ticketapp_session"
3. THE Auth_System SHALL validate form inputs using JavaScript before submission
4. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL display descriptive error messages
5. WHEN authentication succeeds, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect users to the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view a dashboard with ticket statistics, so that I can get an overview of my ticket management status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard, THE Twig_App SHALL verify Session_Token exists in localStorage
2. IF Session_Token is missing, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to login page with alert notification
3. THE Dashboard_View SHALL display ticket statistics including counts by status
4. THE Dashboard_View SHALL provide a logout link that clears Session_Token
5. THE Dashboard_View SHALL render using server-side Twig templates with JavaScript enhancement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create new tickets with title and description, so that I can track issues and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL provide a form interface for creating new Ticket_Entity instances
2. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL validate that title field is required before submission
3. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL validate that status is one of "Open", "In Progress", or "Closed"
4. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL allow optional description with length validation
5. WHEN ticket creation succeeds, THE Toast_System SHALL display success confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view all my tickets in a list format, so that I can see the current status of all my tracked items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL retrieve and display all stored tickets from localStorage
2. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL render tickets with color-coded status indicators (Green for Open, Amber for In Progress, Gray for Closed)
3. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL display ticket title, status, and description in card format
4. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL handle empty state when no tickets exist
5. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL update the display dynamically without page refresh

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to edit existing tickets, so that I can update their status and information as work progresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL provide inline editing capability for Ticket_Entity properties
2. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL validate updated fields using the same rules as creation
3. WHEN ticket update succeeds, THE Ticket_Manager SHALL persist changes to localStorage
4. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL update the display immediately after successful edit
5. THE Toast_System SHALL provide feedback for successful and failed update operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete tickets I no longer need, so that I can maintain a clean and relevant ticket list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL provide delete functionality for each Ticket_Entity
2. WHEN delete is initiated, THE Ticket_Manager SHALL display confirmation dialog
3. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL remove the ticket from localStorage only after user confirmation
4. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL update the display immediately after successful deletion
5. THE Toast_System SHALL confirm successful deletion with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with JavaScript disabled, I want the application to still display content, so that I can access basic functionality even without client-side scripting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Twig_App SHALL render all templates server-side without requiring JavaScript
2. THE Twig_App SHALL display static content and forms when JavaScript is unavailable
3. THE Twig_App SHALL maintain accessible HTML structure for screen readers
4. THE Twig_App SHALL provide semantic markup that works without CSS styling
5. THE Twig_App SHALL ensure core navigation remains functional without JavaScript

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and feedback, so that I understand what actions succeeded or failed and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur, THE Toast_System SHALL display descriptive error messages
2. WHEN localStorage operations fail, THE Toast_System SHALL provide fallback error handling
3. THE Auth_System SHALL display specific validation errors for form fields
4. THE Ticket_Manager SHALL provide clear feedback for all CRUD operation results
5. THE Toast_System SHALL automatically dismiss success messages after appropriate timeout

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be lightweight and performant, so that it loads quickly and provides smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Twig_App SHALL minimize JavaScript bundle size by using vanilla ES6 modules
2. THE Twig_App SHALL implement efficient DOM manipulation without heavy frameworks
3. THE Twig_App SHALL optimize asset loading including SVG and CSS resources
4. THE Twig_App SHALL implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS or SCSS
