## Known Browser Differences

### Safari Specific
- Some CSS features may require `-webkit-` prefixes
- Date formatting may differ slightly
- Font rendering may appear lighter

### Firefox Specific
- Scrollbar styling may differ
- Some shadow rendering may be slightly different
- Font rendering may appear heavier

### Edge Specific
- Should behave identically to Chrome (both use Blink)
- May have different default fonts

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Statistics not displaying
**Solution**: Check localStorage for ticket data, verify JSON is valid

### Issue: Layout broken on mobile
**Solution**: Verify viewport meta tag, check media queries

### Issue: Hover effects not working
**Solution**: Check CSS transitions are supported, verify browser version

### Issue: LocalStorage errors
**Solution**: Check browser privacy settings, verify localStorage is enabled

### Issue: Fonts look different
**Solution**: Verify system font stack, check font-weight values

1. Browser name and version
2. Operating system
3. Screen size/viewport dimensions
4. Steps to reproduce
